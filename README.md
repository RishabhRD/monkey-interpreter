# monkey-interpreter

A simple interpreter for the monkey language described in book "Writing an interpreter in Go".
I may tweak language a little as per I like it to be.

## Goals

- Interpreter should be good enough for reporting errors so should include
  row and col number too.
- Try to be fully functional by utilizing category theoratical concepts whereever possible
- Purity
- Declarative style API for each components

## Contribute?
Well it would be awesome if I get any helps in terms of
- Test cases
- Better abstractions possible
- More mathematical structures
